# Quartz Publisher plugin for Obsidian

This is a plugin designed for my own usage, to let me automatically build any Obsidian subfolder into a static website.

It uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to build the site, and alters the Quartz config on on the fly so that
a single Quartz installation can be used to publish any number of sites.

Have a look at the [Share Note docs](https://docs.note.sx/) if you want to see an example of the output.

*Note: This will only work on Linux/Mac as it uses shell commands which don't exist on Windows.*
